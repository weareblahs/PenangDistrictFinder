# What's this?

This project provides a simpler way to find the district based on your current location (via geolocation or manual search). Multilingual options (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Malay) are provided for convenience.

# What inspired this project?

Every year, Penang will have a water shortage - but most Penang citizens (yes, including me) are confused on the district they're currently staying at, while the official documents about water shortage periods are based on the district (example: Seberang Perai Tengah, Daerah Timur Laut, etc). This web app provides a way for citizens to find their current district based on their current location or area they're staying at (example: George Town, Nibong Tebal, Simpang Ampat, etc).

# Where can I see this project?
